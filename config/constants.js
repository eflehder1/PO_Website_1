    text: 'No single renewable energy generation solution can bring our B2B customers’ operational sites to full energy self-sufficiency and Net Zero energy-related emissions. Even existing, mature renewables must be used in combination and frequently do not make users 100% independent from polluting energy from the grid due to limitations like high CapEx and weather dependence of their energy solutions. This is where TankArc comes in! No established competitor product such as wind, solar, microbial fuel cells or anaerobic digesters individually combines all these advantages:',

    text: '89% of food business respondents in the UK will make “low carbon” business a brand priority by 2025 (Centrica 2020). Additionally, 73% of respondents indicated that they are accelerating plans for more sustainable business. Large food companies like Coca Cola and Diageo have recently invested in large green energy capital projects with E.On. However, even these large projects have only covered 20-60% of the sites’ total energy needs, and there is scope for bioenergy to provide bridge their gap in energy self-sufficiency.According to the Water 2050 Report by Water UK, the situation is similar in our secondary target of water treatment.',
